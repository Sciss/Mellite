- there should be a view factory and a view type - `GraphemeObjView`
- a grapheme is not necessarily a break-point function in the sense that
  there is a logical vertical axis that all views could relate to
- for example, a grapheme view could simply be a succession of sound files,
  or strings
- any vertical positioning must therefore be optional and configurable
- multiple successive elements might want to be shows as a 'compound' view,
  e.g. as a break-point-function we want it to be editable as a connected polygon
- how should 'hidden' elements be shown or accessed? i.e. elements which share
  their time position with other elements
- we have `ParamSpec` to define an axis; where would that be picked up from or stored?
- it could be that we want to see the linear series, even of numbers, without vertical
  interpretation
