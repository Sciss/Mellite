This directory mainly contains "internal" design documents and notes, usually informal, documenting my
thinking process.

Some files are lists to maintain, like the serialization lists in `check-ex.txt` or `check-fsc.txt`, or the list 
of type identifiers  in `TypeIds.txt` and `AdjunctIds.txt`. Some files are there for historical reasons, and
be obsolete or outdated now.
