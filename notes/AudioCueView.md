# New features

- [ ] views: regions (high pri now)
- [ ] views: markers (low  pri now)

Regions works like markers in EisK, but with extending objects.
Markers should be implemented with BiPin, regions with Timeline
or BiGroup{?}. For viewing audio-cue objects, these would be
stored with a conventional key in the attr-map.
