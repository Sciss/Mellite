 - creating objects in the workspace
 - defining a sound process
 - listening to sound
 - attribute map and sound synthesis controls
 - copying objects between workspaces

## Tutorial 2 - Timeline and Audio Files

This tutorial introduces the timeline object and shows how to arrange sound file regions:

 - importing an audio file
 - artifact base locations
 - using the audio file player
 - creating a timeline object
 - dragging audio file regions
 - "global processes" in a timeline
 - routing from an audio region to a global process
 - predefined controls for gain, fade, mute
 - creating a programmed filtering process on the timeline
 - process outputs
 - using the mute state to control filter bypass
 - bouncing to disk

## Tutorial 3...

More tutorials that cover the API and ways of actually programming the system will appear soon (hopefully)...

If you are interested in the confluent versioning workspace, there is [a quite old video](https://vimeo.com/86202332).
I'm planning to cover this topic in updated tutorials.
